I wasn't sure how much work Mel had done on inpaths from reading it,
but I'll certainly be sure to give him credit as well as sending mail
to make sure he has no objections.  Given that you guys don't, I'd say
it's a fair bet that he doesn't, but we'll check just to make sure.
He may even remember who I am...  :)

By the way, since you asked to hear about such things, you may be
interested to hear that Akamai (my corporate masters for the past year
plus) at my suggestion is using the FNV hash algorithm inside certain
Internet mapping software to hash numerical representations of IP
addresses.  Works great.  Thanks!

Anyways, thanks for the speedy response, I appreciate it.
